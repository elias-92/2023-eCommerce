# 2023 Ecommerce

The "Ecommerce" project is a web page designed as a practice exercise to acquire skills in the development of e-commerce applications. Through this platform, users can simulate the online shopping experience, exploring products and adding them to a virtual cart.

The project includes basic functionalities such as user registration, login, product display and product details. In addition, a shopping cart has been implemented where users can add and remove selected products.

To simulate the payment process, a fictitious payment method has been integrated to allow a purchase confirmation. Although no real transaction takes place, this functionality allows understanding the key concepts related to the payment process in an e-commerce environment.
